# quantum-input2target
Variational quantum circuit to turn input quantum states to specified target states. This is a solution to Task 2 of the QOSF Cohort 4 screening.

Uses Pennylane, PyTorch. The tutorial at [https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_state_preparation.html](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_state_preparation.html) was very useful in getting this started.

The choices made in designing the variational circuit and an analysis of the results can be found in the report.pdf file.
